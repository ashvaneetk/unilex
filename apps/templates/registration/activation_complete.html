<p>Welcome to Unilexicon Î². Now you can <a href="{% url 'listings' %}">explore, add and edit vocabularies</a>.</p>
<p>Unilexicon is a small club. Please be civilised as you have the power to edit any public vocabulary on the site.<br>
    It's best to start your own vocabulary to get a feel for the tool and how you can use it.</p>
<p>Please share your feedback to help improve Unilexicon and speed up the official release.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
