<h1>Thank you for considering<br>
    professional membership</h1>
<p>Pro membership also allows you to
    <ul>
    <li>use and export private vocabularies,
    <li>access first class technical support or
    <li>request a team authority multiuser setup for your organisation.
    </ul>
<p>It is also the only means I use to raise funds for development work on Unilexicon.
